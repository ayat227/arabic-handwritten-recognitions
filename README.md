# arabic-handwritten-recognitions
Handwriting Recognition (HWR) is the capability of computers and mobile devices to receive and interpret handwritten inputs. The inputs might be offline (scanned from paper documents, images, etc.) or online (sensed from the movement of pens on a special digitizer, for example).
A handwriting recognition system also includes formatting, segmentation into individual characters, and training a language model that learns to frame meaningful words and sentences.
In this project, we built a model which can classify a new image to an Arabic letter or digit and get accuracy of 98.86% when testing on more than 13000 different images.
