# overview
Automated handwriting recognition has achieved significant real-world success in targeted applications such as address recognition on mail pieces for sorting automation and reading of courtesy and legal amounts on bank checks, using domain-dependent constraints to make the problem tractable. However, unconstrained handwritten text recognition is still an open problem that is attracting renewed interest as an active area of research due to the proliferation of
smartphones and tablet devices where handwriting with a finger or stylus is likely to be a potentially convenient mode of input for these handheld devices
Automated recognition of handwritten is one of the most interesting applications of machine learning. This project poses handwritten Arabic recognition for digits, and characters as a learning problem and provides an overview of the ML techniques that have been used to address this challenging task. so Rely on more papers we read about handwritten recognition just for digits or letters, so we will combine the dataset which contains 38 classes combining letters and digits together.
In this project, we have successfully built a Python deep-learning project on a handwritten recognition with two models one for digits, and characters. we have built and trained the Convolutional neural network which is very effective for image classification purposes. show the accuracy which presents 98.06%
